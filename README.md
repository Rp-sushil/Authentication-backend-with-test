# authentication
## Authentication-backend-with-test

This code demonstrates how we authenticate(backend only) when users log in and keep logged in as long as they are using their account. This code also provides features like create an account, logging in to an account, and logging out of an account. I'm using MongoDB as the database to store users' information. Also, I'm using JWT to keep the user logged in and storing tokens into the headers. To make it more secure, I'm using the idea of a refresh token.
